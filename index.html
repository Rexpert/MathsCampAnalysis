        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This webpage presents a series of data analysis done on the participants of Maths Camp 2019. Maths Camp is an
          annual event which prepared by UUM SQS students who volunteer to be the facilitators. Participants are all
          senior (4<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade) students in the following primary school: from SJK(C) Keat Hwa
          (K), SJK(C) Keat Hwa (S), and SJK(C) Aik Min. I am very pleasure to facilitate this program twice. As a data
          analyst, I decided to practice my data analysis skill on the data I’ve obtained during the Maths Camp 2019.
          <br />
          <br />
          Participants plays 5 difference games in Maths Camp 2019, which are:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Kahoot!, an online quiz among the participants about Mathematics.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I don’t have the data about this game, because the game was played without log in during the event,
                  the game data cannot be saved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This is the <a
                    href="https://create.kahoot.it/share/math-camp-quiz-2019/4dbdcfd7-5b88-4f00-8d4d-0b78b69f5551">Kahoot!
                    question</a> that have been used in the Maths Camp 2019.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Slitherlink, a puzzle about numbers that to be solved in group.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Since the puzzles are different for every groups of participants, it is no point to find the
                  difficulty
                  of each puzzle. Hence, this game has no recorded data.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Pyramid and 4 numbers (数字金字塔 & 神奇的四个数字). This is also a puzzle to be solved in group.
            </li>
            <li>
              Millionaire (大富翁). A game consists of 3 small party games.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The games scores are collected and to be allocated into either Saving or Investment for each group.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The data was input by the facilitators.
                </li>
                <li>

                    system</a>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Gambling game (赌分数), a small game that interspersed between the 4 main games.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This game acts as scoreboard to visualise the scores obtained from the main games.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The input system was designed by me using Java; hence the data was recordable. This is the <a
                    href="https://github.com/Rexpert/MathsCamp19">source code</a> for the input system.

        <h2>Analysis Findings</h2>
        <div id="topic-1">
          <h4>1. Gambling Game: Difficulty</h4>

          <p>
            Gambling game acts as the score board for entire Maths Camp 2019 with 4 rapid-fire maths question to be
            answered by the participants. Participants required to gamble on the magnitude of the points for every
            question, they will receive points on the correct answer or deduct marks for those incorrect answer.
            <br>
            <br>
            The difficulty for every question is different, hence we are going to identify the difficulty by looking at
            the score earned in each question. The question is the easiest when most of the team got it correctly or
            otherwise. The score of each question is displayed in the bar chart below:
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid widget-placeholder" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1980x1080?text=loading widget..."
            alt="widget placeholder">
          <iframe src="./static/gambling.html"></iframe>

          <p class="mt-3">
            From the bar chart, we can see that Question 2 was the easiest question, where every team get the correct
            answer. While Question 4 was the hardest question, there are almost half of the teams answer wrong. In
            overall, the difficulty of the questions seems distributed equally, and the probability to answer the
            questions correctly (without blind guessing) is quite high.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4" id="topic-2">
          <h4>2. Gambling Game: Strategy</h4>

          <p>
            Since they don’t have information for the difficulty of incoming questions, thus they plan the strategy
            based on previous gambling result. We look on their strategy to make a bet on the points after they win or
            lose the previous game. Pie chart below shows the reaction for participants to bet their points based on
            their previous gambling result.
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid widget-placeholder" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1980x1080?text=loading widget..."
            alt="widget placeholder">
          <iframe src="./static/confidence.html"></iframe>

          <p class="mt-3">
            From the pie chart, we can see 2 out of 3 teams cut the points for next gambling when they lose for current
            game. This is a natural move when people facing bad situation, people cut loss for protecting their current
            assets if they are stuck in an undesirable condition.
            <br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, over half of the teams will boost their points in next game if they won the game. This is also a
            natural move when people facing good situation, people looking for opportunity to improve their position.
          </p>

        <div class="mt-4" id="topic-3">
          <h4>3. Millionaire: Difficulty</h4>

          <p>
            Millionaire is a combination of 3 party games: Drawing Guessing, Ponginator and Telephone Game. Participants
            enjoy lots of fun in this section, because these games require more body active elements compared to staring
            at boring maths problem. Assuming the total score distributed fairly in these 3 games, we can identify the
            difficulty of these games by compare the score they earned from these games. The chart below shows the score
            for these party games by each team:
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid widget-placeholder" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1980x1080?text=loading widget..."
            alt="widget placeholder">
          <iframe src="./static/scores.html"></iframe>

          <p class="mt-3">
            From the bar chart above, every team earned highest score in Game 1 (Drawing Guessing) among the 3 games.
            Hence, we can say Drawing Guessing is the easiest game. Besides, every teams got higher score in Game 2
            (Ponginator) than Game 3 (Telephone Game), except for Team Mercury and Team Mars. Thus, we can say Telephone
            Game is the hardest and Ponginator is in between them. The order of difficulty shows ascendingly in the
            following:
            <br>
            Drawing Guessing -> Ponginator -> Telephone Game
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4" id="topic-4">
          <h4>4. Millionaire: Strategy</h4>

          <p>
            Millionaire is another game that host those party games, which the participants are required to allocate
            their money (score) into saving account (Bank) or investment account (Invest). The money in Bank will
            accumulate with 10% interest of the current placement. But the money in Invest will accumulate with 20% of
            profits but there’s a chance to loss 20% in Economy downturn. The bar charts below show the percentage of
            money that allocated in Bank or Invest, after the discussions in each team are made.
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid widget-placeholder" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1980x1080?text=loading widget..."
            alt="widget placeholder">
          <iframe src="./static/moneyAllocation.html"></iframe>

          <p class="mt-3">
            From the series of bar charts, we can see that most of the team are relatively conservative to allocate
            their money. Most of the team allocate their money in Bank account more than 50%, this implies they don’t
            like to take the risk on the investment account, although there is a chance to get the additional 10%
            profit.
            <br>
            <br>
            For practice purpose, I’ve found an optimal solution for the situation:
          </p>

          </div>
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-3">
            <table class="table table-bordered table-sm" style="width: 50%;">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th></th>

                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p class="mt-3">
            The profit should be optimized with the allocation of money into Bank accounts or investment accounts. Let
            \(x\) be the weightage of allocation into Bank account, the expected profit function is stated as below:
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            $$\begin{aligned} E(x) &= \sum xP(x) \\ &= (0.5×(0.1x+0.2(1-x)))+(0.5×(0.1x+(-0.2)(1-x))) \\ &=
            0.05x+0.1(1-x)+0.05x-0.1(1-x) \\ &= 0.1x
            \end{aligned}$$
          </p>
          <p>
            Since \(x\) is only ranged between 0 and 1, and the profit function is linearly increasing, hence the
            maximum value of \(x\) is equal to 1 (where the profit is expected at 10% of the money each round). Hence,
            this strategy suggested that the player should put 100% of money into Bank Account, this is because Bank
            Account constantly provides profit, compared to Investment Account which depends on the economic situation.

          <h4>5. Participants Retention Rate</h4>

          <p>
            Maths Camp is an annual event, that offer for senior students who study in the 3 primary schools. I think
            that the loyalty of participants from the previous Maths Camp can be evaluated for the successfulness of
            this event. This is because the loyalty implies a positive feedback to the Maths Camp committee.
          </p>

          <div class="two-panes">
            <img class="img-fluid widget-placeholder" src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x300?text=loading widget..."
              alt="widget placeholder">
            <iframe src="./static/liquid.html"></iframe>

            <div>
              In our context, the possible loyal clients are the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade (2018)
              participants who joined Maths Camp 2018. 6<sup>th</sup> grade (2018) participants are excluded because
              they are no longer eligible for joining Maths Camp 2019. Among the 94 possible loyal clients, we have 25
              participants who willing to join Maths Camp 2019. The retention rate is 27% and this is good news for the
              Maths Camp committee. It shows the demand of Maths Camp and the approbation of Maths Camp in term of
              quality.
